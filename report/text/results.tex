Classification accuracy varied between the different machine learning techniques and genres. The SVM had a success rate of only 66\% when identifying jazz , most frequently misidentifying it as classical or metal. The Neural Network did worst when identifying metal with a 76\% success rate. Interestingly, the Neural Network only ever misidentified metal as jazz. k-Means did well identifying all genres but Jazz, which was confused with Classical 36\% of the time. k-NN had difficulty differentiating between Metal and Jazz in both directions. Of its 33\% failures identifying Jazz, it misidentifies as Metal 90\% of the time. Similarly, k-NN incorrectly predicted that Metal songs would be Jazz in 66\% of all its failed Metal identifications.

Overall we found that k-NN and k-means yielded similar accuracies of about 80\%. A DAG SVM gave about 87\% accuracy and neural networks gave 96\% accuracy.
