SVM classifiers provide a reliable and fast way to differentiate between data with only two classes. In order to generalize SVMs to data falling into multiple classes (i.e. genres) we use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of two-class SVMs trained on each pair of classes in our data set (eg $f_{14}(x)$ denotes the regular SVM trained on class 1 vs class 4) \cite{dag}. We then evaluate a sequence of two-class SVMs and use a process of elimination to determine the output of our multi-class classifier.
